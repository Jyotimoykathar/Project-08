## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox Css

### Time required

Nearly 4 days required to get the desired page of the project.

### What I learned

This is the css design code snippet of the media queries with attribute selector.

```css
@media (max-width: 84em) {
  .heading-primary {
    font-size: 5rem;
  }
  .description {
    font-size: 1.6rem;
    padding-right: 3.6rem;
  }
  [alt="intro-img"] {
    transform: scale(1.2);
    margin-top: 6rem;
    padding-right: 6rem;
    margin-left: -3rem;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

I still hava lot to learn on different breakpoints of media queries and practise more on image positioning and use on my webpage.

### Useful resources
